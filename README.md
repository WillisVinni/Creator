This program makes it easier to create and store projects.

Tutorial.
Create a folder where you will store projects, install the program there, open it. Next, write a name and select the file extension, after which a folder will appear in the folder where the EXE file is located, the name is identical to the name of the project, it contains two files: main with the extension you selected and start.bat which starts the main file but even after an error it does not close but waits keystrokes.
